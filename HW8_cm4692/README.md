**Figure 1:** Changing of the number of Seattle's bicycle trips ( from west and east sidewalks and sum them up) as time goes from 2013-2015


West line shows the number change of the west sidewalk.
Orange line shows the number change of the east sidewalk.
Green line shows the total number change tendency.
The plot directly shows that the citizens of Seattle are more active in summer than in winter.
What's more, more people choose bicycle as the tool for movement with year increases.
And the people in west sidewalk are more active than who in east sidewalk.
