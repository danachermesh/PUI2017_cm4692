a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly

Null Hypotheses is correct. However, the formula doesn't correctly labeled.

b. verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test was not chosen yet)
Yes it does.

c. chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or here, or Statistics i

I would use two sample T-test because it's from different dsample but from the same distribution.
