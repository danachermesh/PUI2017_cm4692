# HW4
For Assignment 1,  I did individually.                                        
For Assignment 2, group work with yt1369 and hx517.
for assignment 3&4, I group worked with Yixuan Tang (yt1369) and Te Du(td928).         
For Assignment 4, Zhiao Zhou(zz1749) helped me in boroughs problem.

## Outline of what I did
### Assignment 1: Review your classmate's Citibike project proposal.
I reviewed the work of Praveen Matthew Dwyer, mdd328, mddwyer.

### Assignment 2: Literature choices of statistical tests.

| **Statistical Analyses	|  IV(s)  |  IV type(s) |  DV(s)  |  DV type(s)  |  Control Var | Control Var type  | Question to be answered | _H0_ | alpha | link to paper **|
|:----------:|:----------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|:------------- |:------------------|:----:|:-------:|:-------|
 MANOVA	| 1, Light On/Off	Dichotomous	9, larvae activities |	Continous	| 0	| N/A	| Do Zebrafish larvae display rich locomotor behaviour upon external stimulation? |	Locomotor activity before stimulation = Locomotor activity during/after stimulation	| 0.05 | [Statistical Analysis of Zebrafish Locomotor Response](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0139521) 
 |||||||||  
Correlation	| 1, eggs per gram of feces | Numerical | 1，The numbers of the worms| Numerical | 1, 1，	egg-positive or negative |  categorical | 	If the numbers of the worms correlated with the egg counts in human clonorchiasis | there was no significant positive  correlation between eggs per gram of feces and numbers of worms | 0.001 | [Correlation between Discharged Worms and Fecal Egg Counts in Human Clonorchiasis](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001339) |
 ||||||||| 
Logistic Regression	| 10, patients’ characte（age, disease duration, fractional disease duration (disease duration/age), age at diagnosis of T1DM, baseline HbA1c, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), insulin dose per injection, total daily insulin dose, visit interval to the hospital） | continuous (could also be categoridcal) | 1, HbA1c status satisfactory or not| categorical |   | continuous (could also be categoridcal) | 	identify patient characteristics that were predictive of satisfactory glycaemic control in the paediatric population | a specific patient characteristics has no correlation with HbA1c status | 0.05 | [Prediction of glycaemic control in young children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus using mixed-effects logistic regression modelling](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182181) |
  


### Assignment 3: Reproduce the analysis of the Hard to Employ program in NY.
Did the Z-test and the Chi-squre test.

### Assignment 4: Tests of correlation using the scipy package with citibike data.
Used the ArcGis to determine whether a point is in a certain borough.
