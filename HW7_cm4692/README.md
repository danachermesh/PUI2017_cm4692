## Assignment 1
I finished my assignment 1 with my teammate Yixuan Tang. We finished our work on HW3.

My classmate sk6167 gave me a suggestion that I could use T-test to test this conclusion.
However, after my conprehensive consideration, i decide to give the suggestion up and choose Z-test as my testing method because my two samples sizes are much bigger than 30.

We choose another dataset from 2016-12 to perfect our conclusion.
